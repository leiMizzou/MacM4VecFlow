# MacM4VecFlow
This project is built on the macA4 architecture, forming a distributed system by connecting multiple A4 devices. It leverages the combined processing power of these machines to run parallel tasks.Specifically, the system targets a PostgreSQL database, where it processes selected records by applying modern vector embedding techniques. The resulting vector representations are then stored in dedicated vector fields within the database, enabling efficient data retrieval and advanced analytics.
